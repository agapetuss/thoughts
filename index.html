                    To even begin this process, we must first analyze the root causes of evil and inequality in our society. Let's take it apart. Because of its interconnected nature, it can be described as a functioning system that has elements and connections between those elements. In our case, the elements represent humans and the connections, social relations.<br>\
                    A society is defined as 'the totality of people regarded as forming a community of interdependent individuals', so we can presume the first human society was formed around 300.000 years ago. In the early ages, there was nothing inherently wrong with humans. However, for this, we must first assume the elements that form a huma, so, for the sake of the argument, let's adopt the human as made of two parts: physical body and soul. If we were to be made of body only, the idea of 'free will' would be instantly infirmed, seeing the mechanical nature of the organic structure. Not only this, but the fact that each individual recieves sensorial information from a single biological entity alone proves the unique nature of the human (the only one we currently know of) architecture.<br>\
